## 💡 Why This Bot?

Most AFK solutions are either:

* Too simple
* Easily detected
* Too resource-heavy
* Or lack flexibility

This bot focuses on **control, configurability, and consistency**.

**What makes it better?**

* Doesn’t rely on mods
* Runs externally
* Uses human-like timing
* Simple configuration
* Works across multiple server types
* Built specifically for long-term AFK sessions
* Lightweight, minimal resource usage

If you want a bot that just works without bloated features or complex setups, this is it.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings use basic Python variables.

Example:

```python
jump_delay = 2.5
auto_eat_threshold = 6
spam_message = "AFK Bot Active"
```

**Rules:**

* Numbers → no quotes
* Text → `"quotes only"`

## ⚡ Optimization

A slight delay is intentionally included to stabilize timing and avoid repetitive patterns.

Future versions will include:

* Performance presets
* Randomized behavior modes
* Smart server adaptation

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

When creating an issue, include:

✅ Error message / screenshot
✅ Server type
✅ Minecraft version
✅ Expected vs actual behavior

This helps solve issues faster.
